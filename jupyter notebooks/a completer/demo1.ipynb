    "## Theoretical part:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple comparisons problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**P value:** Probability that we would observe the same result if our hypothesis was wrong. In other words, we believe we are seeing a significant result when it was actually just chance This amounts to a Type 1 error. We obviously want to avoid making these mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary: small value p $\\\\implies$ greater certainty of the veracity of our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple comparisons problem arises when we test a **set** of hypotheses with a certain p-value. As an example, let's take a scenario where we test 30 hypotheses with a p-value of 0.05, or 5%. Let's assume that **every single one of our hypotheses is wrong**. What is the probability of observing at least one significant outcome by chance?\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that we have at least one significant result is the complement of the probability of observing none.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(at\\\\ least\\\\ one\\\\ significant\\\\ result\\\\) = 1 - P(no\\\\ significant\\\\ result) $$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$= 1 - (0.95)\\^{30}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\\\approx 79%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that it is very likely that we would get a significant result that would cause us to make a type 1 error.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How can we solve this problem?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonferroni correction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bonferroni correction corrects this problem in a fairly simple way by dividing the p-value by the number of hypotheses we want to posit:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n$ be the number of hypotheses, our p-value becomes $\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{n}$ where $\\\\alpha$ was our original p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now notice that our original calculation is adjusted:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(at\\\\ least\\\\ one\\\\ significant\\\\ result\\\\) = 1 - P(no\\\\ significant\\\\ result) $$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = 1 - (1 - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{n})\\^{30}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$= 1 - (1 - \\\\frac{0.05}{30})\\^{30}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\\\approx 1 - (1 - 0.00167)\\^{30}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\\\approx 1 - 0.9512$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\\\approx 5%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this correction takes into account that all hypothesis tests are *independent*. If there is a positive correlation between them, the Bonferroni correction will result in an **overly conservative**p-value. This will result in Type 2 errors, i.e. rejecting a significant result when it is **valid**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other more common and effective approaches exist to eliminate this problem, such as the Holm-Bonferroni method and Sidak correction. They are much less naive and more interesting. I invite you to take a look at them if you're interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression toward the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, it is the principle that if the value of a variable seems extreme during an initial test, it will probably be closer to the mean in the second test. This may lead us to erroneous conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic example is to take a class of students and have them randomly answer a test composed of 100 true or false questions, *while* *taking* *into* *account that there is no negative correction ;)*. We obviously expect the class average to be 50%. However, some students will be lucky and will have above-average grades and vice versa for the unlucky students. In short, we will have an approximately normal distribution of scores with 50% as an overall average.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we repeat the experiment with the students who were lucky in the first exam, we will obtain a new normal distribution centered at 50%. Same scenario for the students who were less fortunate on the first test.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the illusion that students who scored poorly on the first exam improved on the second and that students who scored well on the first exam did not study enough on the second. However, we know very well that this is not the case, since all students answer randomly!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called regression toward the mean. Obviously, the previous example is very unrealistic. In real life, these are often scenarios where several factors affect a certain outcome, not just luck. This is what leads us to form hypotheses to explain certain trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, it must be realized that the \"natural tendency\" of regression toward the mean can sometimes fully explain results when one could make erroneous assumptions to explain them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend that you watch a very good and fairly popular video that deals with an instance of this cognitive bias, a study that tried to determine whether positive or negative reinforcement was more effective in the training of Israeli military fighter pilots:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tSqSMOyNFE\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed during the course with the example of a medical test for a relatively rare disease that sometimes gives false positives, Bayes' theorem is used to calculate **conditional probabilities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A\\|B) = \\\\frac{P(B\\|A) \\\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula can be obtained by combining two instances of the definition of conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A\\|B) = \\\\frac{P(A \\\\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(B\\|A) = \\\\frac{P(B \\\\cap A)}{P(A)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $P(B \\\\cap A) = P(A \\\\cap B)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A\\|B)\\\\cdot P(B) = P(B\\|A)\\\\cdot P(A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, dividing the two sides by $P(B)$ gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A\\|B) = \\\\frac{P(B\\|A) \\\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical part :\n",
    "\n",
    "We can already dive into the practical side now that we know Bayes' Theorem. We can implement the naive Bayes classifier using the MNIST dataset. To do so, it would be advantageous to be comfortable with Jupyter and Python 3. See the tutorials below if you are not familiar with this environment:\n",

    "# WARNING:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The following exercice can be completed in full by following the document below (pages 1 to 8). If you want to complete the entire implementation by yourself (recommended), do not read the rest of this notebook. However, my biased opinion is that this notebook is much clearer and more intuitive than this document. If you want to be guided, you can follow the steps described in the rest of the notebook. A version of the notebook with the missing code will also be published on the website. If you choose to do this on your own, don't forget to go back to the notebook and read the \"Conclusion\" section.**\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70/sp15/notes/n21.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first look at how to use the MNIST dataset for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MNIST dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST dataset is a large database of images of handwritten numbers. These images are $28 \\\\times $28 pixels in size. In the file *\"mnist\\_train.csv\"* that we will use, these data are organized as a table (see CSV data format). If you open this file in Excel or a text editor, you will see that it consists of 60,001 rows and 785 columns. These columns are separated by commas, hence the name CSV (Comma Separated Values). Each line corresponds to a data point. The first column represents the label, which is the real class of the figure. The following columns represent the value of each pixel in the image. These columns are the dimensions of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are $28 times 28 = $784 pixels in the image, we have a total of 785 columns including the label. The 60,001 rows are explained by the 60,000 data and the first row containing the column identifiers. Each piece of data is actually a vector of 784 dimensions composed of integers ranging from 0 to 255 for each dimension, as well as the label of that data. These numbers represent the intensity of a grayscale pixel, with 0 being the black end of the scale and 255 being the white end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing MNIST into the Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to use the `csv` module to import the file *\"mnist\\_train.csv\"*. This file is available on the course website. To simplify the path to be specified in the `open()`function, I suggest you put this file in the same directory (folder) as this notebook. Here's how to get a list of lines from the file:"

    "### Implementation of a naive Bayes classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle behind the naive Bayes classifier is the following: let's say we have a number of classes $n = \\|C\\|$ (10 in our case): $C = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}$) and $x$, a vector that represents our image. Using Bayes' theorem, we can determine **the posterior** $P(c\\|x)$, which is the probability that our vector belongs to class $c$ given its representation as the vector $x$ using the following equation :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(c\\|x) = \\\\frac{P(x\\|c) \\\\cdot P(c)}{P(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate this probability, we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The likelihood** $P(x\\|c)$, which is the probability of obtaining a vector $x$ given that the vector belongs to the class $c$.\n",
    "- **The prior** $P(c)$, which is the probability of having a class $c$ image in our dataset.\n",
    "- **The** **evidence** $P(x)$ , the probability of having a vector $x$ in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we can calculate this probability, we can do so for each class to which $x$ could belong and choose the class that generates the maximum conditional probability. We can express this with the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(x) = \\\\operatorname\\*{argmax}\\_{c \\\\ \\\\in \\\\ C}  \\\\ P(c\\|x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We use $h(x)$ here to denote our **hypothesis function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by calculating **the evidence $P(x)$**, which is the probability of having a vector $x$ representing an image in our dataset **(representing any number)**. We can use the law of total probability to calculate it. This will be the sum of all the probabilities of obtaining the $x$ vector as a representation of **each of the numbers**weighted by the probability of observing that number, i.e. the **prior** $P(c)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x) = P(x\\|c\\_1) \\\\cdot P(c\\_1) + P(x\\|c\\_2) \\\\cdot P(c\\_2) + \\\\dots + P(x\\|c\\_n) \\\\cdot P(c\\_n)$$ $$= \\\\sum\\_{j=1}\\^n P(x\\|c\\_j)P(c\\_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, our scenario implies that $n = 10$. We can substitute $P(x)$ in our hypothesis function. We get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(x) = \\\\operatorname\\*{argmax}_{c \\\\ \\\\in \\\\ C}  \\\\ P(c\\|x) = \\\\operatorname\\*{argmax}_{c \\\\ \\\\in \\\\ C}  \\\\ \\\\frac{P(x\\|c) \\\\cdot P(c)}{\\\\sum\\_{j=1}\\^n P(x\\|c\\_j)P(c\\_j)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe that **whatever** the class for which we calculate $P(c\\|x)$ for a vector $x$, the denominator always remains the same since it is calculated in the same way. It is then important to understand that if a value $V\\_1$ is greater than $V\\_2$, and that we divide the two values by a **positive** constant $c$, the inequality $\\\\frac{V\\_1}{c} > \\\\frac{V\\_2}{c}$ is always satisfied. This is the case here since the denominator is a probability, which implies that it can never be negative. Therefore, **we do not need to calculate the evidence $P(x)$ in our hypothesis function** since it will have no impact on the maximum value of $P(x\\|c) \\\\cdot P(c)$. So our hypothesis function becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(x) = \\\\operatorname\\*{argmax}_{c \\\\ \\\\in \\\\ C}  \\\\ P(c\\|x) = \\\\operatorname\\*{argmax}_{c \\\\ \\\\in \\\\ C}  \\\\ P(x\\|c) \\\\cdot P(c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect! One less term to calculate. Let's continue by calculating the **prior** $P(c)$, which is the probability of having an image which belons to class $c$ in our dataset. To calculate this probability for a particular class, simply count the number of data with the label of that class and divide it by the total number of data :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(c) = \\\\frac{# data\\\\ in \\\\ class \\\\ c}{# total \\\\ data}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$P(A\\_1, \\\\dots, A\\_n) = P(A\\_1) \\\\times P(A\\_2\\|A\\_1) \\\\times P(A\\_3\\|A\\_1, A\\_2) \\\\times \\\\dots \\\\times P(A\\_n\\|A\\_1, A\\_2, \\\\dots, A\\_{n-1})$$\n",

    "If we make the **naive** hypothesis that these probabilities are **independent**, we have by definition that each term $P(x\\_i\\|c, x\\_1, x\\_2, \\\\dots, x\\_{i-1})$ becomes $P(x\\_i\\|c)$. Assuming that these probabilities are independent is to assume that there is no correlation between the pixels, which is not the case. There are other versions of the Bayesian classifier that take these correlations into account, see the section **\"for maniacs\"** in the conclusion. However, let's see what results we can obtain with this \"wild assumption\".\n",

If you are not familiar with binomial distributions, I strongly recommend you take a look at it since it is an important topic.\n",

    "\n",
    "**However, there is a problem with the previous formula, namely the fact that $p\\_{ji}$ can be zero.** This would happen if we were to **never** see a value of 1 for a pixel $i$ among all the images of a class $j$ in our test set. *Why is that a problem?*\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have just completed this implementation of the naive Bayes classifier. Some relevant questions arise in relation to this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we hadn't rounded each pixel to a binary value, what **distribution** would we have used to model $P(x\\_{ji} = k), \\\\ 0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 255?$ What **problem** would we have had if we had decided to include these probabilities in our model?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Was the **Laplace smoothing** really necessary? What would have happened if we had not taken the smoothing into account? Is our $h(x)$ still valid? Also, what error rate indicates a model that doesn't work? Is it 100%?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. As mentioned earlier, calculating $\\\\log(h(x))$ is equivalent to calculating $h(x)$ since $\\\\log(x)$ is a **monotonically increasing** function. Could we use a **monotonically decreasing** function $f(x)$ to compute $f(h(x))$ and get the same result, or should we make a modification to our $h(x)$?\n",
    "\n",
    "### For maniacs\n",
    "\n",
    "This model uses the **naive** assumption that there is no correlation between the pixels in our images. There is a Gaussian variant of the Bayes classifier that takes this into account. The next step in this exercise would be to implement it. A word of encouragement: it reduces the error rate to less than 5%.
