    "## Theoretical part:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple comparisons problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**P value:** Probability that we would observe the same result if our hypothesis was wrong. In other words, we believe we are seeing a significant result when it was actually just chance This amounts to a Type 1 error. We obviously want to avoid making these mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary: small value p $\\implies$ greater certainty of the veracity of our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple comparisons problem arises when we test a **set** of hypotheses with a certain p-value. As an example, let's take a scenario where we test 30 hypotheses with a p-value of 0.05, or 5%. Let's assume that **every single one of our hypotheses is wrong**. What is the probability of observing at least one significant outcome by chance?\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that we have at least one significant result is the complement of the probability of observing none.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(at\\ least\\ one\\ significant\\ result) = 1 - P(no\\ significant\\ result) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$= 1 - (0.95)^{30}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\approx 79%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that it is very likely that we would get a significant result that would cause us to make a type 1 error.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How can we solve this problem?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonferroni correction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bonferroni correction corrects this problem in a fairly simple way by dividing the p-value by the number of hypotheses we want to posit:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n$ be the number of hypotheses, our p-value becomes $\\frac{\\alpha}{n}$ where $\\alpha$ was our original p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now notice that our original calculation is adjusted:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(at\\ least\\ one\\ significant\\ result) = 1 - P(no\\ significant\\ result) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = 1 - (1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{n})^{30}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$= 1 - (1 - \\frac{0.05}{30})^{30}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\approx 1 - (1 - 0.00167)^{30}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\approx 1 - 0.9512$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\approx 5%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this correction takes into account that all hypothesis tests are *independent*. If there is a positive correlation between them, the Bonferroni correction will result in an **overly conservative**p-value. This will result in Type 2 errors, i.e. rejecting a significant result when it is **valid**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other more common and effective approaches exist to eliminate this problem, such as the Holm-Bonferroni method and Sidak correction. They are much less naive and more interesting. I invite you to take a look at them if you're interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression toward the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, it is the principle that if the value of a variable seems extreme during an initial test, it will probably be closer to the mean in the second test. This may lead us to erroneous conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic example is to take a class of students and have them randomly answer a test composed of 100 true or false questions, *while* *taking* *into* *account that there is no negative correction ;)*. We obviously expect the class average to be 50%. However, some students will be lucky and will have above-average grades and vice versa for the unlucky students. In short, we will have an approximately normal distribution of scores with 50% as an overall average.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we repeat the experiment with the students who were lucky in the first exam, we will obtain a new normal distribution centered at 50%. Same scenario for the students who were less fortunate on the first test.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the illusion that students who scored poorly on the first exam improved on the second and that students who scored well on the first exam did not study enough on the second. However, we know very well that this is not the case, since all students answer randomly!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called regression toward the mean. Obviously, the previous example is very unrealistic. In real life, these are often scenarios where several factors affect a certain outcome, not just luck. This is what leads us to form hypotheses to explain certain trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, it must be realized that the \"natural tendency\" of regression toward the mean can sometimes fully explain results when one could make erroneous assumptions to explain them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend that you watch a very good and fairly popular video that deals with an instance of this cognitive bias, a study that tried to determine whether positive or negative reinforcement was more effective in the training of Israeli military fighter pilots:\n",

    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tSqSMOyNFE\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed during the course with the example of a medical test for a relatively rare disease that sometimes gives false positives, Bayes' theorem is used to calculate **conditional probabilities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula can be obtained by combining two instances of the definition of conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(B|A) = \\frac{P(B \\cap A)}{P(A)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $P(B \\cap A) = P(A \\cap B)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B)\\cdot P(B) = P(B|A)\\cdot P(A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, dividing the two sides by $P(B)$ gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$"

    "### Implementation of a naive Bayes classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle behind the naive Bayes classifier is the following: let's say we have a number of classes $n = |C|$ (10 in our case): $C = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}$) and $x$, a vector that represents our image. Using Bayes' theorem, we can determine **the posterior** $P(c|x)$, which is the probability that our vector belongs to class $c$ given its representation as the vector $x$ using the following equation :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(c|x) = \\frac{P(x|c) \\cdot P(c)}{P(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate this probability, we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The likelihood** $P(x|c)$, which is the probability of obtaining a vector $x$ given that the vector belongs to the class $c$.\n",
    "- **The prior** $P(c)$, which is the probability of having a class $c$ image in our dataset.\n",
    "- **The** **evidence** $P(x)$ , the probability of having a vector $x$ in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we can calculate this probability, we can do so for each class to which $x$ could belong and choose the class that generates the maximum conditional probability. We can express this with the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(x) = \\operatorname*{argmax}_{c \\ \\in \\ C}  \\ P(c|x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We use $h(x)$ here to denote our **hypothesis function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by calculating **the evidence $P(x)$**, which is the probability of having a vector $x$ representing an image in our dataset **(representing any number)**. We can use the law of total probability to calculate it. This will be the sum of all the probabilities of obtaining the $x$ vector as a representation of **each of the numbers**weighted by the probability of observing that number, i.e. the **prior** $P(c)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x) = P(x|c_1) \\cdot P(c_1) + P(x|c_2) \\cdot P(c_2) + \\dots + P(x|c_n) \\cdot P(c_n)$$ $$= \\sum_{j=1}^n P(x|c_j)P(c_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, our scenario implies that $n = 10$. We can substitute $P(x)$ in our hypothesis function. We get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(x) = \\operatorname*{argmax}_{c \\ \\in \\ C}  \\ P(c|x) = \\operatorname*{argmax}_{c \\ \\in \\ C}  \\ \\frac{P(x|c) \\cdot P(c)}{\\sum_{j=1}^n P(x|c_j)P(c_j)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe that **whatever** the class for which we calculate $P(c|x)$ for a vector $x$, the denominator always remains the same since it is calculated in the same way. It is then important to understand that if a value $V_1$ is greater than $V_2$, and that we divide the two values by a **positive** constant $c$, the inequality $\\frac{V_1}{c} > \\frac{V_2}{c}$ is always satisfied. This is the case here since the denominator is a probability, which implies that it can never be negative. Therefore, **we do not need to calculate the evidence $P(x)$ in our hypothesis function** since it will have no impact on the maximum value of $P(x|c) \\cdot P(c)$. So our hypothesis function becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(x) = \\operatorname*{argmax}_{c \\ \\in \\ C}  \\ P(c|x) = \\operatorname*{argmax}_{c \\ \\in \\ C}  \\ P(x|c) \\cdot P(c)$$\n",

    "Perfect! One less term to calculate. Let's continue by calculating the **prior** $P(c)$, which is the probability of having an image which belons to class $c$ in our dataset.

    "**Since we have rounded each pixel $x_i$ to a binary value**, we can model $P(x_{ji}|c_j)$ with a binomial distribution where the number $n$ of Bernoulli trials is 1. A binomial distribution where $n = $1 is also called a Bernoulli distribution. If you are not familiar with binomial distributions, I strongly recommend you take a look at it since it is an important topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define the probability that a pixel $i$ of class $j$ is a $1$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_{ji} = 1) = p_{ji}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that it is a $0$ is therefore the complement of $p_{ji}$. We have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_{ji} = 0) = (1 - p_{ji})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the binomial distribution, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_{ji}|c_j) = p_{ji}^{x_i}(1 - p_{ji})^{1-x_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to calculate the likelihood, we just have to calculate $p_{ji}$ for all $j$ classes and $i$ pixels. It's a simple enough calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{ji} = \\frac{\\# pixels \\ i \\ equal \\ to\\ 1 \\ for\\ the\\ data\\ of\\ class\\ j}{\\# total \\ data\\ in\\ class \\ j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, there is a problem with the previous formula, namely the fact that $p_{ji}$ can be zero.** This would happen if we were to **never** see a value of 1 for a pixel $i$ among all the images of a class $j$ in our test set. *Why is that a problem?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us remember that we have just demonstrated that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x|c_j) = \\prod_{i = 1}^{784} P(x_{ji}|c_j) = \\prod_{i = 1}^{784} p_{ji}^{x_i}(1 - p_{ji})^{1 - x_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If even **one** of the $p_{ij}$ values  is null, **our entire product will be nullified**. Suppose we have a pixel $k$ that is always black in the images of our training set (a pixel in a corner, for example). We'll have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{jk} = 0 \\implies \\prod_{i = 1}^{784} p_{ji}^{x_i}(1 - p_{ji})^{1 - x_i} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This regardless of the values of $p_{j1}, p_{j2}, \\dots, p_{j \\ k-1}, p_{j \\ k+1}, \\dots, p_{j \\ 784}$ which can be very good probabilities. To remedy this problem, we use **Laplace smoothing.** We adjust the formula as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{ji} = \\frac{\\# (\\ pixels \\ i \\ equal \\ to \\ 1 \\ for \\ data \\ in \\ class \\ j \\ )\\ + 1}{\\# (\\ total \\ data \\ in \\ class \\ j \\ ) \\ + 2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes $p_{ji}$ **strictly** greater than 0 and less than 1. We add 2 to the denominator since we are working with a **binomial distribution**. This technique is also known as **additive smoothing**. Laplace smoothing is also used in bag-of-words modelling in natural language processing. For more information, see :\n",

    "Let's start by calculating $p*{ji}$ :\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, initialize a list `sum_pixel_values` which will be a 2-dimensional matrix (list of lists) containing the sum of all pixel values $x*{ji}$ in `x_train`. Specifically, `sum_pixel_values` will have a dimension of $10 \\times 784$. Then calculate these values. **Reminder:** $j$ is the $j^{th}$ class ($0 \\leq j \\leq 9$) and $i$ is the $i^{th}$ pixel ($0 \\leq j < 784$).\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have just completed this implementation of the naive Bayes classifier. Some relevant questions arise in relation to this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we hadn't rounded each pixel to a binary value, what **distribution** would we have used to model $P(x_{ji} = k), \\ 0 \\leq k \\leq 255?$ What **problem** would we have had if we had decided to include these probabilities in our model?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Was the **Laplace smoothing** really necessary? What would have happened if we had not taken the smoothing into account? Is our $h(x)$ still valid? Also, what error rate indicates a model that doesn't work? Is it 100%?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. As mentioned earlier, calculating $\\log(h(x))$ is equivalent to calculating $h(x)$ since $\\log(x)$ is a **monotonically increasing** function. Could we use a **monotonically decreasing** function $f(x)$ to compute $f(h(x))$ and get the same result, or should we make a modification to our $h(x)$?\n",
    "\n",
    "### For maniacs\n",
    "\n",
    "This model uses the **naive** assumption that there is no correlation between the pixels in our images. There is a Gaussian variant of the Bayes classifier that takes this into account. The next step in this exercise would be to implement it. A word of encouragement: it reduces the error rate to less than 5%.
