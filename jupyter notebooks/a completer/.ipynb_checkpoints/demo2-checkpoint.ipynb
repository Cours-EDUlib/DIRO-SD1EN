It is a free library that contains many useful models for classification, regression, data partitioning (clustering), dimensionality reduction, etc... Instead of reinventing the wheel and reimplementing each time a classical machine learning algorithm, it is strongly recommended to use this library. Scikit-learn has been designed to be usable with other scientific libraries such as NumPy and SciPy.\n",

    "### Data Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Data partitioning is the process of partitioning all of our data into different groups based on distance. The aim is to minimise intra-group distance and maximise inter-group distance. The goal is to discover underlying structures in our data. However, compared to the classification problem, the problem of data partitioning is poorly defined (what is a group?). In this section, we will first look at cases where some algorithms presented during the course get bad results. Later, we will see a measure allowing us to find an appropriate number of $k$ centroids for the k-means method. Finally, we will see a modified version of k-means based on a prototype example rather than a centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## k-means\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into this section, here is a reminder of the k-means algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose $k$ centroids randomly, ${m_1, ..., m_k}$\n",
    "- Repeat if the stop condition is not met\n",
    "  - Assign each point to the nearest centroid, $G_i = {x \\vert \\forall j \\neq i, D(x, m_i) \\leq D(x, m_j)}$\n",
    "  - Recalculate the centroid for each group, $m_i = \\frac{1}{|G_i|} \\sum_{x \\in G_i} x$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can notice that there are two main steps that are similar to the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. First there is the E step where all the data points are assigned to a group. Then there is the M step where we determine the new centroids. These two steps are repeated until a certain stop condition is reached, e.g. a predetermined number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see k-means in action and try it on different datasets, I invite you to try the algorithm yourself: https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-k-means-clustering/. Take the time to look at the two main steps of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** for simplicity, we have chosen the initial centroids randomly. Be aware that there are other methods that allow k-means to converge faster. In scikit-learn, you can decide how this selection is made by changing the value of the parameter `init` (see the documentation of [`kMeans`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html)). For example, it is possible to use the initialization technique `k-means++` which will choose distant initial centroids in order to converge faster. In general, if you want to use a modified version of an existing algorithm, take the time to look at the scikit-learn documentation. It is likely that it is possible to simply change a parameter to suit your needs!\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any method, k-means has several assumptions *.*  k-means assumes that the groups are spherical, have similar sizes and have an equivalent number of examples. When these conditions are not met, it is very likely that the method will find a local minimum and return a \"bad\" result. To illustrate this phenomenon, let's test k-means on data that do not respect these assumptions."

To evaluate the partitioning, we will use the average silhouette score for all of our data. A high value means that the partitioning is adequate, conversely a low value means that the selected $k$ is inadequate.\n",

We have seen a modified version of k-means to handle data that are not in a Euclidean space. We have also seen a method to find the best hyperparameter  $k$ for our k-means method. In addition, throughout the demonstration, we became familiar with the great library scikit-learn!\n",

    "1. As the objective of k-means is non-convex, this algorithm often returns local minima: i.e. partitionings that are not optimal. However, in practice, this is not a major problem, because the algorithm is applied several times with different _seeds_ . To highlight the phenomenon of local minima, use the data `X` below, set the argument `init` from `kMeans` to `'random'` and change an argument from `kMeans` to use a single _seed_ (Refer to the documentation). Apply the algorithm several times and display the different partitionings found by `kMeans`. See how the results can vary widely..."
